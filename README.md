Welcome to SINATRA UNIVERSITY!

This web app allows you to create a profile to Sinatra U. Once a profile is created feel free to enroll in one of the 4 courses listed on the 'Courses' page. When enrolled, only the user who enrolled in the class can edit or delete it altogether. Don't like the courses listed? Create a new one to enroll in! 

Fork and clone this app if you'd like to customize what happens. To run the app, in terminal run shotgun and go to http://localhost:9393/
